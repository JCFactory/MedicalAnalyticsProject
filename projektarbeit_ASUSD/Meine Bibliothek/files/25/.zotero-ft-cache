Gene Info - An Open Source Chrome Extension for Easy Gene Annotation Retrieval

Gene Info is an open source extension for the Chrome web browser that allows automated retrieval of gene annotation information for any gene name, synonym or supported accession number on an open web page within Chrome. Searching or double-clicking on text terms retrieves gene function annotation, GO terms, external database links, and interaction data drawn from BioGRID and IntAct. Retrieved gene names are automatically hyperlinked for rapid recursive searches.

GeneInfo is fully open source, available online at GitHub and is downloadable here . Tutorial videos and a step-by-step guide is available online . GeneInfo was developed by James Knight in the Gingras Lab at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, Canada.
